# What's the Point?
A hack that captures the textual content of any conversation, lecture, or a meeting etc. using speech recognition algorithms and __summarizes__ them using Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms.

##Built With
* Python 2.7
* NLTK for Python
* [Sumy text summarization library](https://github.com/miso-belica/sumy)
* [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API)
* :blue_heart:

##Running
###Setup
1. For the server, ensure all pre-requisites and dependencies for [Sumy](https://github.com/miso-belica/sumy) are in place (python modules, etc.)
2. The web client currently works only on latest versions of Google Chrome

###Run
```shell
python app.js       # starts the web server on port 5000, as well as the summarization service
```
